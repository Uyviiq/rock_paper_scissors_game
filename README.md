I built a Rock Paper Scissors game in Python. It was part of Day 4 from Angela’s “100 Days of Code” bootcamp. It uses `random`, list indexing, and simple input handling. That’s it. Nothing deep. Nothing innovative.

I know it’s basic. But I finished it. I guess that’s something. I could act like I’m proud but let’s not pretend this changes anything. I’m still just sitting here, trying to learn Python and C like some loser who thinks mastering low-level code will fix something in his life.

This repo won’t get attention. No one’s going to star it. No one will even see it. It’s just me uploading code into the void. Like most things I do. Quiet. Forgettable. I’m not the main character. I’m not some misunderstood genius. I’m just tired. And maybe miserable. But I finished the challenge.

How to run the game

1. Open your terminal  
2. Navigate to the folder containing the file  
3. Run the following command:

bash
python3 Rock_paper_scissors.py

Make sure Python 3 is installed.
